# Capstone steps

1. Choose a frequently updated website, API, or RSS feed. Connect to the API and gather data.
2. Create a Python script that obtains the data. Clean / transform / do anything needed to the data. Consider efficiencyâ€”we do not want to scrap all the data every time, just the delta of the new data.
3. Check that data still needs to be added to the DB. Insert gathered data into the database.
4. This script will be run periodically. DF team will take your .py file and .env and put them on to our server, running on a schedule using cron
5. Create a visualisation on Streamlit that demonstrates an aspect of the data
